program < in > out

Here, the "in" file is treated as stdin and the "out" file is treated as
stdout when "program" runs.

And here:

program | less

Here, the stdin of "program" is the usual stdin, and the "pipe" passes output of 
a program.
The output of "less" is sent to the usual stdout.


Thus, the pipe passes output as input to another program,
whereas redirection
sends an output to a file or reads a file as input
