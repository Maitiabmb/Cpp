The first three hex characters are: cof

The binary equivalent of 0xcof is:

 |-(1)-| |-(2)-|  |-(3)-|  |-(4)-|
 
 (1) - "the next 2 bits hold the value 3", thus 11
 
 (2) - "the next 5 bits hold the value 0", thus 00000
 
 (3) - "the next 4 bits hold the value 7", thus 0111
 
 (4) - "the next 4 bits hold the value 15". for the first three hex characters,
